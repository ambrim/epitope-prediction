Remember that to keep this demo lightweight, we used one of the smallest ESM models, focused on human proteins only and didn't put a lot of work into making sure we only included completely-annotated proteins in our training set. With a bigger model and a cleaner, broader training set, accuracy on this task could definitely go a lot higher!"
